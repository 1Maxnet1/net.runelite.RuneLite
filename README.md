# RuneLite Flatpak

This is a Flatpak build of the Open Source [RuneLite](https://runelite.net/)
client for [Old School RuneScape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/) by Jagex Games.

The primary motivation for the creation this Flatpak was simple:
Keep RuneLite from cluttering up the user's home folder.

The package is maintianed by @rushsteve1. I'm admittedly not good at keeping up
with it so please open issues or reach out to me at the email on my account.
